##Epithumeo

                             To lust after things forbidden.

## Mission

Let's Talk About Sex. The goal of this project is to encourage people to speak more openly about sex. 

Our mission is to open the lines of communication around all things sexual to begin diminishing the stigmas attached to noncriminal paraphilias. A lack of educational resources leads to a disheartening number of deaths that could otherwise have been prevented. By educating professionals and the public, together we can reduce the guilt from needless embarrassment and begin to repair the lives damaged by shame.
